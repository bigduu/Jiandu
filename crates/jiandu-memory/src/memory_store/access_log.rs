//! L5 cheap access-frequency signal (#264, follow-up to #263's `memory_value`).
//!
//! The RFC's intended L5 keep-value signal is `recency × access × confidence`,
//! but the access term was omitted in #263 because it wasn't tracked:
//! `DurableMemoryRetrieval::last_accessed_at` exists but writing it back onto the
//! recalled document on the read path would force a full per-scope index rebuild
//! on every recall (the store rebuilds all per-scope indexes on every document
//! write) — unacceptable on a hot path.
//!
//! Instead, recall appends a tiny `{id, ts}` line to a per-scope append-only
//! `access_log.jsonl` (see [`super::store::MemoryStore::record_memory_accesses`]):
//! O(ids) appends, no document rewrite, no index rebuild. The capacity gardener
//! reads/aggregates that log lazily (only when it actually runs an eviction pass —
//! not on the hot path) into an [`AccessStats`] per memory id, and
//! [`access_multiplier`] turns that into the multiplier `memory_value` documents
//! as its seam.
//!
//! This module is pure logic (parsing, aggregation, the multiplier formula,
//! compaction policy) with no I/O — [`super::store::MemoryStore`] owns reading,
//! writing, locking, and compacting the actual file.
